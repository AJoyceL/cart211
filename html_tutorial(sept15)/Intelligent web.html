            Web 4.0 is often envisioned as the “ubiquitous Web” or “Intelligent Web”, where artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things (IoT) are fully integrated into daily life.

           In this stage, the Web becomes a seamless environment in which humans, devices, and intelligent agents interact continuously. Personalized assistants, autonomous systems, and real-time machine learning make the Web highly adaptive and context-aware.
